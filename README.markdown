## Stairs examples living here


### Projects:

**Hacker News**

You can find in this example some basic information about
stairs components.

It's a good example of statistic and analytic problems. Here we could
easily grab a ton of data from Google Cloud and calculate any stats
values which we want. Stairs will make calculations in parallel way. 
And it's quite safe (no reason to lose, duplicate your data).

The idea to grab some data from Google Cloud about Hacker News post
and calculate different values based on topic.

**Kaggle to Github**

This project is about parsing and how stairs could help you
extract data from any source.<br>

The main goal is to parse kaggle competions and link them to
github repositories (which were mentioned inside.)

In this example you can see all power of Flow components and 
data pipelines itself.

Note: we are considering to make some pipelines compatible with
python async, which will improve experience with such tasks/projects.



**Bag of words**

Is basic example of ML algorithms for solving text/nlp problems.
You can find a very good example of this task on kaggle pages:

https://www.kaggle.com/c/word2vec-nlp-tutorial

There is a well build dataset and get started guide on solving this problem.

Here we have an example of how stairs could help on solving ML related
tasks. The amount of data is not very big here and it's not very related
to "streaming" idealogy, but it's a good example how ML playground 
could instantly became a production ready enviroment,  it's always
easy to tune and change the logic and it's always ready for big amount of
data.
